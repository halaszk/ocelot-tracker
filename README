### About

Ocelot development continues with project gazelle (http://whatcd.github.io/Gazelle/).

This repo is based on an older 0.6 release of ocelot. We have added a few patches related to setuid(), ipv6, and c++11 refactoring (by SHTheSuper).

I'm not a what.cd member or developer, I just stumbled across the source code a few years ago.

### License

Ocelot 0.6 did not ship with a license file. I don't know what the original
developers' wishes were, but the standard disclaimer no doubt applies;

OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
